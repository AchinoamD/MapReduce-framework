# MapReduce-framework
MapReduce is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating large data sets with a parallel, distributed algorithm on a cluster. A MapReduce program is composed of a Map() procedure that performs filtering and sorting, and a Reduce() procedure that performs a summary operation. The MapReduce framework orchestrates the processing by marshalling the distributed servers, running the various tasks in parallel, managing all communications and data transfers between the various parts of the system, and providing for redundancy and fault tolerance.
